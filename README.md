Crystals Collector!

This game was created to show my understanding of jQuery. Each gem adds a specific amount of points when clicked. The goal of the game is to get your points to reach the 'Winning Number.' If you reach it exactly, you win and gain a point. If you go over, you lose. Winning adds to your 'Wins' points and displays the word "Winner!" While a loss adds to your 'Loss' points and displays the word "Bummer!"

The game also utilizes 3 vertical containers to enclose 3 main sections: the instructions, the crystals to click, and the points counter. The top uses a banner with a colorful background.
